### Hi, nice to have you here! ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™

I'm Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider â€“ I am faculty in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois (UIUC). My passion is at the intersection of systems, data, and creating tools to nerd out with both systems and data â€“ particularly through interactive tools and data visualizations. In my work, I work to educate, encourage, and inspire you to change the world.  See https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/ for more about my role at UIUC.


### Projects

I absolutely love code and there is something âœ¨ _magical_ âœ¨ about being able to create something that can impact the world with just a keyboard!  There's a few major projects I have worked on in the past few years:

- My Massively Open Online Courses on Coursera [`wadefagen/coursera`](https://github.com/wadefagen/coursera): ["Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1?specialization=cs-fundamentals) _100k students_, ["Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals) _40k students_, ["Ordered Data Structures"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-2?specialization=cs-fundamentals) _20k students_, and ["Unordered Data Structures"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-3) _10k students_.
- My 91-DIVOC project [`wadefagen/91-divoc`](https://github.com/wadefagen/91-divoc), which provided data-forward visualizations of COVID-19 data, used by [governors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3jBUTx5eQ4&t=2633s) of [multiple states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UoHDfHPvV4&t=888s) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- University of Illinois projects and datasets [`wadefagen/datasets`](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets) including the [GPA visualizations](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa/), [UIUC LinkedIn Banner Generator](https://d7.cs.illinois.edu/projects/linkedin-banner-image/), among others.


### 2024: The Year of FULL SEND

I never want to stop creating, and each year I choose a theme to define the year.  This year, my theme is to [FULL SEND](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7148783633808375808/).  Some projects that I've already started working on:

- [**Mastery Platform**](https://mastery.cs.illinois.edu/platform/), to re-imagine how homework and learning can be done at The University of Illinois and beyond.
- **Data Science Clicker**, because a great student response system should be simple.
- **visualized**, to get back to my visualization roots!


Come by and say hello and lets nerd out! :)
